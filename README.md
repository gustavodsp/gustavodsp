### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gustavo Pereira. 
I'm from Brazil, but I'm currently living in Dublin-Ireland. 
I'm a Mechatronic Engineer who decided to migrate to development field, so I postgraduated in Computer Science at National College of Ireland in 2020.
I had my first contact with a programming language on my first semester at the Engineering course in 2010 and it was love at first sight. When I finish it, I started to study deeply about programming as a hobby, but then I realized that it is what I want to do for the rest of my life.
I'm currently learning Kotlin, since i'm passionate for Java and Android Development, but I'm willing to work with any other language and framework to add it to my pool.

If you want to get in touch, find me on LinkedIn!
